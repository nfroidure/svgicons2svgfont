### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

### Debugging informations
- `node -v` result:
```
<paste here>
```

```
<paste here>
```
If the result is lower than 6.9.5, there is
 poor chances i even have a look to it. Please,
 use the last [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Feature request
<!--

If you think a feature need to be added, your suggestions
 are welcome. Beware though that:
- I try to keep my module simple so please ensure the requested
 feature is really related to this module. If not, you may
 instead create a module that augment/work with this one,
- I am not your employee so keep calm and be aware that your
 request may stay incomplete for ever. Nothing impeach you
 to implement the feature and get it merged though.
